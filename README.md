Detection_Breast_Cancer_Thermogram_ROI_Segment

Breast Cancer Detection in Thermographic Images In our study, for breast cancer detection in thermographic images, the first step of the computer-aided detection (CAD) algorithm is to extract the regions needed for the next steps.
Region of Interest (ROI) is an important preprocessing step during image analysis and classification. Preprocessing may be used to remove unwanted parts (such as arms and neck) or noise from the thermal image of the breast in order to examine the desired region. Background information usually reduces the accuracy of classifications, ROI extraction can be performed as one of the preprocessing steps.
